# About

Welcome to my MkDocs documentation! This is the main page of the documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with MkDocs, you can follow these steps:

1. Install MkDocs using `pip install mkdocs`.
2. Create a new MkDocs project with `mkdocs new my-project`.
3. Edit the `docs/index.md` file to customize your documentation.

## Adding a New Page

You can add new pages by creating additional Markdown files in the `docs` directory. MkDocs will automatically include them in the documentation.

## Customizing the Theme

You can customize the appearance of your documentation by editing the `mkdocs.yml` file. Choose a theme and configure the settings according to your preferences.

For more information, check out the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Happy documenting!
